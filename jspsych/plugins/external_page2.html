  <h1>Study Title:</h1>
  <p> Multisensory Metacognition: Probing Perceptual Confidence Using Audiovisual Stimuli </p>
  
  <h1>Person(s) conducting the research:</h1>
  <p>Brian Odegaard, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology</p>
  <p>Email: bodegaard@ufl.edu </p>
  <p>Phone: 352-392-0601</p>
        
  <h1>Purpose of the research study:</h>
  <p>The primary purpose of this study is to examine how effectively you can make judgments about
      audiovisual stimuli and to evaluate how you rate confidence in things you have seen.</p>
        
  <h1>What you will be asked to do in the study:</h>
  <p>First, you will be asked if you fulfill the eligibility criteria for this study, which include verifying that you
      are 18 years or older, have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, and do not have a history of
      seizures, epilepsy, or stroke. If you fulfill these criteria and agree to be in this study, you will be asked to
      sit in front of a computer monitor with speakers placed on each side. On each trial in this experiment,
      you may be asked to (1) report the number of beeps and/or flashes that have been presented, and to also
      rate your confidence in what you have seen. Or alternatively, (2) judge the syllable that was spoken from
      short audiovisual video clips, and rate your confidence in your judgments about the video.</p>
        
  <h1>Time required:</h>
  <p>One session, which can last up to 60 minutes.</p>
        
  <h1>Risks and benefits:</h>
  <p>There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study. The risk to participants would
      not exceed anything that a participant may experience in everyday life. Very similar studies have been
      conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Brian Odegaard. There are no direct benefits of participation
      to you, but you will be contributing to scientific knowledge about how the brain evaluates audiovisual
      stimuli.</p>        
    
  <h1>Alternative to participating in the study:</h>
  <p>You may participate in other studies posted on SONA instead of this study.</p>
        
  <h1>Confidentiality:</h>
  <p>Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Your information will be assigned a
      code number, and your name will not be attached to your data in any way, thus ensuring that your
      responses are completely anonymous. Your name will not be used in any report.</p>
        
  <h1>Compensation:</h>
  <p>Participants who will be participating in this study through SONA as part of the participation pool will
       receive 2 course credits for the 60 minute study.</p>
        
  <h1>Withdrawal from the study:</h>
  <p>You are free to withdraw your consent and to stop participating in this study at any time without
      consequence. If you withdraw, your information will not be used in any analysis. The researcher also
      reserve the right to withdraw you from the study for inattentiveness or task negligence.</p>
